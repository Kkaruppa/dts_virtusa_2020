Download from Consul portal. Choose particular package based on the operating System. Once downloaded the zip, we need to unzip it to desired place.
Start Consul Agent in local workstation – The Zip file that we have unzipped, has only one exe file called consul.exe. We will start a command prompt here and use below command to start the agent.
